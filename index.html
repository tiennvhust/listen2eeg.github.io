        <h1>Listen to EEG!</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;The original AI-assisted sonification algorithm was first introduced in [1]. This algorithm utilizes the Phase Vocoder (PV) algorithm with an AI-guided time-compression factor as an attention mechanism. It combines AI algorithms' accuracy and speed with sonification's interpretability and intuitiveness to enable a quick, accurate, and interpretable seizure detection method requiring little to no medical workers' training.<br>&nbsp;From that, a real-time adaptation of this algorithm was developed that overcome the limitations in the previous studies offline-processing approach allowing output audio to be always available for listening. Medical workers can have access to real-time audio at any time without having to periodically restart the sonification algorithm, enabling seizure detection as soon as they occur.<br>&nbsp;This new adaptation has modifications in the architecture and algorithm implementation. While the original algorithm was implemented in Matlab, its real-time adaptation was implemented in C/C++ using the available open-source mathematic libraries. A thorough comparison was performed to guarantee the unchanged performance of the AI-assisted sonification algorithm in real-time implementation.</p>
